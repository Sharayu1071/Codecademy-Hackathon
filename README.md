# :star2: Introduction

In this situation, coronavirus spread like wildfire to every corner of the world. One of the most common problems faced by todayâ€™s people is a lack of knowledge of diseases and a lack of immediate first aid consultation. Due to this many people may suffer from physical and mental stress as they try to figure out the reason for their condition. In some cases, they even lost their lives and common diseases become life-threatening.

In such a scenario, patients are now largely being advised to take online consultations with doctors in the comfort of their own home instead of physical consultations at the hospital in the clinic.

so online consultations are much better than physical consultation at the clinic and our application provides many more good services that provide smooth and easy home tests. Home Clinic also has a special section for COVID19 vaccination in which user can book their vaccination slots, this makes it different from the existing system. It has a user-friendly interface, and itâ€™s more accurate than the existing system.
